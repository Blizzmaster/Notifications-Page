## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned


```html
<h1>I'm not an frontend starter but it really let me remember the basics of a section component and the use of CSS components using TailwindCSS. I rather use a CSS framework than a pure CSS because i want a clean page and get an understanding at CSS clases that i put in the tags </h1>
```
```js
<h1>I am too used to using JQuery instead of pure Javascript, so it was quite challenging and took me a few minutes to figure out how to define the elements to modify on the page.</h1>
```

### Continued development

I will review each of the challenges on the page to improve my front-end development counterpart and continue on the path towards full-stack development.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I review a lot the Tailwind Docs to create the webpage template  
- [Coing Tube Challenge Atempt](https://www.youtube.com/CodingTube) - This is an amazing channel where he teach me how to make the web page template . I use the TailwindCSS instead pure CSS to improve the code readibility
